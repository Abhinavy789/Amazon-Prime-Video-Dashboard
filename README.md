# Amazon Prime Dashboard

## Description

This project analyzes Amazon Prime content using data from `amazon_prime_titles.csv` and `Radial Bar chart values.txt`. The dashboard provides insights into Amazon Prime's offerings, including the top 10 genres, shows by type, shows by release year and type, top ratings, and total shows by country. Additionally, users can select a specific show or movie to view its description, type, cast, release year, genre, and duration.
